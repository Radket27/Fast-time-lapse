# Fast-time-lapse
### Software to make time lapses from picture sequences

This software works only with MoviePy installed.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

To run this software you should add arguments with picture sequence names, all pictures should be the same resolution.

```bash
python3 fast_time_lapse.py picture1.jpg picture2.jpg
```

After running this software you can decide if you want to sort pictures by name or not (by default sorting is enabled).\
Then you can set the number of frames per second.\
After that you can set the name of your time lapse video.
